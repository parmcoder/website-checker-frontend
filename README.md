Vue2 with vuetify is what we need. But, let's go beyond with vue3 template!

# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

# Set up guide

First time here? Run this command and it should take you around 5 mins.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
# Restart your terminal console once
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

From this root repository,

```
npm install && npm run dev
```

Start development server

```
npm run dev
```

If you want to install dependencies, try this fancy ui from Vue CLI
